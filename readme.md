# My Ansible Collection

This repository contains a collection of my useful Ansible playbooks, roles, and tasks that I've created and use for personal or work-related automation. The goal of this collection is to simplify and streamline various automation tasks using Ansible.

## Contents

- **Playbooks**: High-level automation tasks written using Ansible.
- **Roles**: Organized tasks, templates, and variables that can be reused across different playbooks.
- **Tasks**: Specific automation tasks grouped by functionality.

## Getting Started

To get started with this collection, you'll need to have Ansible installed on your system. If you don't have it yet, follow the [official Ansible installation guide](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-ansible-collection.git
cd my-ansible-collection
